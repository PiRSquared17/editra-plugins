#summary Description page for TerminalPlugin

= Introduction =

This plugin project has two parts:

1) This plugin creates a terminal widget that emulates the system shell such as /bin/bash or cmd.exe on Windows. This widget is being developed in part with plans to make it a usable component/program even outside of Editra's plugin framework

2) It creates a plugin that implements the Shelf Interface, meaning that it allows for multiple instances to be open in the tabbed Shelf window that can be either docked or dragged into a separate floating window from Editra's main window.

= Implemented Features =
  * Basic framework is in place and it can be used just like your system shell but still has a number of display and behavior issues to fix up before an official release.
  * Support for ANSI color code escape sequences to allow for coloring of different file types.
  * Command history recall with Up and Down keys.

= Planned Features =

  * Interaction with system shell should be able to be killed in the event of an infinite loop in a shell command, as to not bring the editor down with it.
  * Customizable appearance, font, colors, ect...
  * Configurable line buffering for ui display
  * Search output by linking into Editra's quick find bar
