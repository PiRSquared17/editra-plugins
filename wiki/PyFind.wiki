  * The first button on the left gives access to the PyTools configuration dialog. There are currently no configuration options specific to the PyFind component. See the general configuration on the PyTools main page for information about configuring the Python installation for the development environment to use.
  * The text field near the right edge of the window is a free form text field for entering the module name you wish to search for. The enter key can be used to initiate a search.
