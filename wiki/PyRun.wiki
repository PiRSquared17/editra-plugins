#summary PyRun is a python script launching and output display plugin

= Introduction =

PyRun is a Shelf plugin that can run the script that is in the current buffer and display its output in a text buffer in the Shelf. The scripts can be launched using the hotkey that PyRun is assigned by the shelf (Cmd+Alt+_Number Key_), after a PyRun instance is open in the Shelf the script can be rerun by using the "Run Script" button.


= Current Features =

  * All output from running script shown in a builtin output buffer in Editra's Shelf.
  * Run multiple scripts simultaneously without blocking usage of any other parts of Editra
  * Abort a running script at any time
  * Configure which python executable to use for running script(s)


= Planned Features =

  * Save and configuration for multiple versions of python and allow easy switching at runtime
  * Allow PyRun instance to automatically associate with current buffer without needing to open new instance of PyRun
