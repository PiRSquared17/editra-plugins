#summary Projects plugin summary and planned features

= Introduction =

The Projects plugin integrates the features of a file manager and source control into a self-contained, easy to use side panel.  Simplicity and transparency is the main focus of the Projects plugin.  It requires no "project files" and almost no configuration.  The Projects plugin treats directories as projects.  You simply add a directory as a project and the Projects plugin automatically tracks files in that directory.  If the files are under source control (currently either CVS or Subversion), the icons for those files will indicate the status of the files.  You can also do most source control operations using the right-click menu.
